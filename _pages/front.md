Hello there!

I'm studying physics & CS at Seoul National University since 2017.
Currently, I'm really interested in deep learning and working as
AI scientist in [MindsLab](https://mindslab.ai) as a substitute of mandatory military service.
Still wondering why there are so many AI scientists who had once majored physics.

I haven't done anything special in physics career since I came SNU, yet.
See my works on CS at [GitHub](https://github.com/seungwonpark) if you're interested.
Most of them are related to LaTeX, CP(Competitive Programming), and DL(Deep Learning).
