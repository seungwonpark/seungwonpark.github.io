I'm studying physics at Seoul National University since 2017.
Currently, as a sophomore, I'm studying hard on physics and my research interest is still pending.

I'm also passionate about computer science — I'm double majoring in CS since 2018.
Most of my works are published on [GitHub](https://github.com/seungwonpark).

My dream is to be a professional physicist and make a happier world with my works on physics.
