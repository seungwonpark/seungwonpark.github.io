Hello there!

I'm physics & CS undergrad. student at Seoul National University.
**From September 2022, I'll be working as a Machine Learning Engineer (MLE) at [Moloco, Inc.](https://www.moloco.com/).**
I'm currently doing a research on speech/singing voice synthesis at [Supertone Inc.](https://supertone.ai/)
while jointly interning at [MARG](http://marg.snu.ac.kr/).
Before that, I worked as a Head AI Scientist at [MINDsLab Inc.](https://mindslab.ai)

I love reading & implementing deep learning papers and sharing ideas of them with others.
