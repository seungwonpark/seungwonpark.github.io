I hereby recognize that I can use part of my income to do a significant amount of good.

Since I can live well enough on a smaller income,
I pledge that from November 2022 and until October 2025 (3 years),
I shall give at least 3% of my income to whichever
organisations can most effectively use it to improve the lives of others.

I make this pledge freely, openly, and sincerely.

Seungwon Park, 2022-11-03.
