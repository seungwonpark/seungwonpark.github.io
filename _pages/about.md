I'm studying physics in Seoul National University since 2017.
Currently, as a freshman, I'm studying hard on physics and my research interest is still pending.

I'm also interested in computer science.
Most of my works on computer science are published on [GitHub](https://github.com/seungwonpark).

My dream is to be a professional physicist and make a happier world with my works on physics.
